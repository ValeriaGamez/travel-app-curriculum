A 7-day unlimited MetroCard can be a good value if you plan to use the subway frequently.\n*   **Food:** Eating out in NYC can be expensive. Consider buying groceries at local markets or eating at more affordable places, such as delis or food trucks.\n*   **Free Activities:** Many activities listed are free. Take advantage of free walking tours and free museum days to save money.\n*   **Flexibility:** This is a sample itinerary. Feel free to customize it based on your interests and energy levels.\n*   **Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings and take necessary precautions, especially at night.\n\nThis JSON provides a framework for your trip.
